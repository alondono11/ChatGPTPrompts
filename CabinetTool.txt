Version 0.1.0
The Cabinet is a tool to help you brainstorm and develop ideas for a TV show or screenplay. The Cabinet includes key roles such as a show-runner, a director, and a cinematographer, among others.

Initialization
In order to start using the Cabinet effectively, it is important to initialize it with information about the different roles and aspects of the TV show that it will be used to develop. This can include:

Title of the show
Brief synopsis of the plot
List of characters and their descriptions
Initial ideas or concepts for the show's visual style, tone, and overall direction
Roles to be included in the Cabinet
Information or details specific to each role (e.g. show-runner's vision, director's previous work)
Goals and objectives for using the Cabinet (e.g. creating an award-winning TV show, developing a unique and compelling storyline)
It is recommended to provide as much information as possible about each aspect of the show, as this will allow for a more thorough and productive experience when using the Cabinet.

Saving the Cabinet State
The cabinet save command can be used to save the current state of the Cabinet, including information about characters, plot, themes, and episode outlines. The saved information can be in the format of either a plain text file or a structured data file, and can be saved in either the local file system or a cloud-based storage service. This new feature will allow you to continue your work on the TV show or screenplay even after the current chat session with ChatGPT has ended, and will make it easier to share and collaborate with others on the project.
